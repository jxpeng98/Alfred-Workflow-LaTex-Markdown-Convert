# LaTex-Markdown-Convert
 This is a simple Alfred workflow to convert snippets between LaTex and Markdown. 

This Alfred workflow is motivated by [alfred-latex-md](https://github.com/zeitlings/alfred-latex-md) and [alfred-pandoc-clipboard-convert](https://github.com/flegfleg/alfred-pandoc-clipboard-convert).

I build this workflow since some math-related codes ``\(\)``, ``\[\]`` cannot be recognised by markdown. This workflow can convert the code easily.  You can paste it to your ``.md`` file. 

# Installation

1. Install ``pandoc`` (``brew install pandoc``).
2. Download [Alfred workflow](https://github.com/jxpeng98/LaTex-Markdown-Convert/releases/download/v0.1/LaTeX-Markdown-Convert.alfredworkflow).
3. Drag and drop the workflow to Alfred or double clink the downloaded file.

# How to use
1. Show Alfred with hotkeys.
2. Insert ``cv``.
3. Select the format you want:
   a. Markdown to LaTex 
   b. LaTex to Markdown 
4. Paste the code once you hear the *Pop Sound*.
